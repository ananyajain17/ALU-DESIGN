# ALU-DESIGN
Objective: Design and synthesize a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with operational modes using Verilog and Design Compiler (DC).

Specifications:

00: ALU off
01: 4-bit addition
10: 4-bit subtraction
11: No operation
Design Details:

Use flip-flops for synchronization of inputs, outputs, and control signals.
Synchronize using a clock and flip-flops to ensure proper timing.
Outcome: Synthesize the ALU design to produce a gate-level netlist.
